# tempest

A weather app targeted at farmers, for Interaction Design coursework


# Setup

`src/` contains the bulk of the Java source code.
`lib/` contains jar libraries that the source code is built with and requires to function.
`resources/` contain resources that will be packed into the built JAR itself (e.g. images)

Your build environment of choice should be setup to take this into account.


# Useful stuff

The JDK I am using:

The page which helped me set up JavaFX in IntelliJ:

JavaFX scene builder is also good stuff. You can edit the scenes (.fxml files in src/scenes) with it on a drag and drop way (**be sure to download version 2.0; 1.1 is buggy!**)
